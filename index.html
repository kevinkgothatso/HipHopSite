        This list is about the top meaningful hip hop projects of the 2010s. I must admit, it was not easy 
        making up this list, I had so many entries and from those entries, only a handful of projects had
         to make the top 10. To write about about the most commercially successful albums of the 2010s, 
         now that would be easy, as so many sources of information are available on that but the most meaningful albums 
         that's hard, somebody must get me a towel, I am sweating over here. without wasting time, lets see what are my most
          personally meaningful albums.

            <img src="FOTO.jpeg">
           
            <p>Imagen your life shown on a photo album!, now that is what Kota the friend has created with the album,
     the album is filled with wisdom and inspiration. the albums dives in on topics such as racism, unconditional love ...
     and. the album gets a thumbs up from me, it reminds the listener to take a photo now and then, because,
     what matters now, is truly what shapes, what is next to come </p>

   <img src="Coloring Book.jpg">
<p><em style="color: crimson">"Am I the only ni**a that still care about mixtapes"</em>, well I'm certainly not, this is
the only mixtape that made the list and it's worthy of a listen,
the project is filled with positive emotions and vibes.the mixtape is gospel themed,
talking about the love for God, the album reminds me of how much peaceful and fun 
it was being a child. Who is the happiest person on earth? its probably a child,
 who has parents that care and love the child unconditionally.</p>

    <h2 class="albumName"> Saba: Care 4 Me (2018)</h2> <br>
 
 <img src="Care 4 Me.jpeg">
<p>This Saba's second studio album, an artist most have never  heard, since the most meaningful projects don't 
    get charts recognition, Care 4 contains Sabas most diaristic storytelling, 
   mostly about his life and the life and death of his cousin Walter Long J. The album
   talks about mental health, self-care...and grief.</p>

    <h2 class="albumName"> Kendrick Lamar: good Kid, m.A.A.d city (2012)</h2><br>
   
  <img src="good Kid m.A.Ad City.jpeg" >
<p>Ohh My, another Kendrick Lamar project of the list: the is no arguing that Kendrick is a talented
artist that makes music with impactful meaning, that's why you will probably find most of his albums on most Hip-Hop lists.
the album is a masterpiece like many of the albums that made the list, it talks about the influence your peers can have on your character, internal struggles ...and what truly makes an individual feel like he lived a purposeful life.</p>

<strong><nav>Notable songs: </nav>Singing About Me, I'm Dying Of Thirst, Real, The Art Of Peer Pressure, and Sherane.

    <h2 class="albumName">  Kendrick Lamar: To Pimp a Butterfly (2015)</h2>  <br>
  
 <img src="Pimp a Butterfly.jpeg">
<p>Another one: This album might be one of Kendrick's most famous albums, after it scoped so many well-deserved grammies.
     To Pimp a Butterfly unlike most of his albums,where you have to dig deep to find its meaning, this
one comes off as straight forward. It talks about African-American culture, racial inequality, and i
nstitutional discrimination.my all-time favorite was "How much a Dollar Cost".</p>
<strong><nav>Notable Songs:</nav> Hood Politics, The Blacker The Berry, How much a Dollar Cost, and You Ain't Gotta Lie. </strong>

    <h2 class="albumName"> J.Cole: 2014 Forest Hills (2014)</h2><br>

 <img src="2104 Forest Hills.jpeg">
<p>The album that talks about love, freedom, happiness and a lot of other themes, the album was named after the address
     of his childhood home he bought back from a foreclosure, j cole starts of the album with "do you want to be 
        happy ?" and talks about how we all want to be happy and be filled with a sense of purpose in life and ends with the track 
      "Note to self" that talks about loving one another and giving credits to the people that helped him craft an amazing 
       album filled with positive emotions.</p>
        <strong><nav>Notable songs:</nav> Apparently, Hello, No Role Modelz, and Love Yourz.</strong>

   <div class="container add">
    <h2 class="albumName">Kendrick Lamar: DAMN. (2017)</h2><br>
 <img src="DAMN.jpeg">
<p>This is the only Hip Hop album that has won the Pulitzer award, the most prestigious award,
awarded once every year since 1943. The album talks about loyalty, fear, love, lust, faith amongst other themes,
well my personal favorites is FEEL. where he talks about negative emotions 
<em style="color: crimson">"The feelin' of an apocalypse happening,but nothing is awkward, the feelin won't prosper, The feeling is toxic.. " </em>. This is worth listening to and rumor has it the album tells a
different meaning from track 1-14 and 14-1, definitely recommend it.</p>
        <strong><nav>Notable Songs:</nav> LOVE., FEEL., LOYALTY. and DNA.</strong>
